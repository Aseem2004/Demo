<h1> Hi everyone !! </h1><br>
This is just a demo repository in which I am trying out on different functions of Python libraries used in Machine Learning.<br>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>When values are continuous we use Regression and when values are categorical we use Classification.</li>
  <li>Linear Regression is always used in Regression and Logistic Regression is always used in Classification problems</li>
  <li>KNN algorithm can be used in both Regression and Classification. It uses the concept of Euclidean distance.</li>
  <li>CART algorithm can be used in both Regression and Classification. It uses the concept of finding entropy.</li>
  <li>Different algorithms give different accuracies, we need to select the algo which gives maximum accuracy.</li>
</ul>
